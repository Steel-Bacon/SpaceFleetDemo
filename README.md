# SpaceFleetDemo
A little android game I made for personal entertainment. Build with Android Studio.

* design your engine, design your weapon, and then design your ship class with those equipment!
* use what resources you have to actually build the ships and fight enemy fleet!
* each turn you get some resources and research point, spend them wisely
* try to survive as long as you can! 

PS. there's no save game mechanism, and make sure to hit the end battle button or the game could be bugged
